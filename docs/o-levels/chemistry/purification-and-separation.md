# Purification and separation

## What is a pure substance?

* Single substance that is not mixed with anything else
* **Fixed** melting and boiling point
* Only produces a single spot on chromatogram

## What is a mixture?

* Consists of 2 or more substances that are mixed (not chemically combined together, can be separated)
* An impure substance can be a mixture of more than 2 substances (water + sand + silt)
* **Melts and boils** over a range of temperatures
* **Boiling point becomes higher**
* **Melting point becomes lower**

## The importance of purity

1. Extent of a reaction
2. Efficiency of a reaction
3. Efficacy of a chemical
4. Price of a chemical

## Separation technique

Easily separated using physical methods

### Decanting

Separates an insoluble solid from a liquid by pouring off the liquid from the container carefully

### Filtration

Used to separate an insoluble solid from a liquid

**Apparatus:**

1. Beaker
2. Filter funnel
3. Filter paper

**Key terms:**

* Residue
* Filtrate

### Evaporation to dryness

Separate dissolved solids from a solution

Some solids are not heat stable and will decompose when heated, even after evaporation, some impurities will still be
present in the solution.

**Apparatus:**

1. Evaporating dish

### Crystallization

Separate dissolved solid from a solution, forming pure crystals of the substance

Filtrate has to be saturated before flame is turned off

Rinse crystals with cold distilled water (to remove impurities)

Solubility of solute decreases as temperature decreases, extra solute that cannot remain dissolved is separated as pure
crystals


**Apparatus:**

1. Evaporating dish
2. Filter paper
3. Bunsen burner
4. Beaker
5. Filter funnel
6. Stirring rod

**Key terms:**

* Filtrate
* Solvent
* Crystals
* Impure solid

### Sublimation

Used to separate a mixture of solids, one of which sublimes

!!! tip "Examples"

    * Iodine in iodine and sand will sublime when heated
    * Solid CO2 (dry ice)

Ammonium compounds can also sublime

### Simple distillation

Separates a pure liquid from a solution

**Apparatus:**

1. Distillation flask
2. Boiling chips
3. Thermometer
4. Liebig condenser
5. Conical flask

### Fractional distillation

Separate mixtures or miscible liquids with different boiling points

### Chromatography

Used to separate and identify mixtures

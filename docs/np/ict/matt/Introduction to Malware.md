# Introduction to Malware (Raw) 
Last Updated 19/10/22 11am


## Defining Malware
#### Malware = Malicious Software/Software created with Malicious Intent

### Usage
this list is not completed yet, perhaps you can work to expand this :)

### Malware Symptoms

1. Increased CPU Usage
2. Slow computer/web browser speeds
3. Problems connecting to network
4. Frrezing or Crashing
5. Strange computer behaviour

### Types of 'wares
1. Adware
 - type of malware that automatically delivers advertisements
 - Eg. pop-up ads on websites displayed by software
 
2. Bot <sub><sup>(aka Botnet too)</sub></sup>
 - created to automatically perform specific operations

3. Bug
 - is a flaw that produces an undesired outcome (because it can be exploited)
 - Security bugs are the most severe type of bugs 

4. Ransomware
 - form of malware that holds a computer system captive while demanding a ransom

5. Rootkit
 - type of malicious software designed to remotely acces/control a computer without being detected by users or security programs.

6. Spyware
 - type of malware that functions by spying on user activity without their knowledge
 - capabilities can include : activity monitoring,collecting ketstrokes, data harvesting 

7. Trojan Horse
 - type of malware that disguises itself as a normal file/program to trick users into downloading and installing malware

8. Cryptojacking  
 - crypto mining requires a lot of a CPU, so hackers "borrow" your computer's resources
 - hides on your device and steals its computing resources in order to mine for valuable online currencies like Bitcoin.

9. Virus
 - malware that is capable of copying itself and spreading to other computers
 - often spread to other computesr by attaching themselves to various programs 
 - executes code when a user lauches one of those infected programs

10. Worm
 - spread over computer newtorks by exploiting OS vulnerability
 - typically harm their host networks by consuming bandwidth and overloading web servers


## Malware Analysis Techniques <sub><sup>(brief introduction)</sub><sup>
1. Basic Static Analysis
 - not executing the malware , looking for dependencies (dll files), strings

2. Basic Dynamic Analysis
 - observation of the malware when it is executed
 - involves running the malware and observing its behaviour

3. Advanced Static Analysis
 - Consists of reverse-engineering the malware's internals by loading the executable into disassembler and looking at the program instructions in order to discover what the program does
 - Steeper Learning curve, requires specialized knowledge of disassembly, code constructs, and Windows OS concepts
 - Observe and understand the Assembly code to figure out the purpose and target of the malware

4. Advanced Dynamic Analysis
 - Reverse Engineering. Executes the code and goes through the code line by line, by setting breakpoints
 - Uses a debugger to examine the internal state of a running malicious executable
 - provides another way to extract detailed information from an executable
 - most useful technique when trying to obtain information that is difficult to gather with the other techniques

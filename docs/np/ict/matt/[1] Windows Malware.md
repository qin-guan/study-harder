# Windows Malware
  - windows most popular OS
  - malware interacts with OS via API to execute codes

## Windows API
  - Windows uses its own naming method to represent data types in the C programming language
  - WORD = 16 bits unsigned value <sub><sup>(2 bytes)</sub></sup>
  - DWORD = 32 bits unsigned value <sub><sup>(4 bytes)</sub></sup> 
  - Handles = ?
  - Long Pointer = ?
  - Callback = represents a function that will be called by the Windows API
  - also uses Hungarian Notation for API function identifiers
 
  ### Hungarian Noration 
  - something like Camel Case , looking at the function name will depict the code's purpose
  - eg. CreateFile / ReadFile / WriteFile - it does what its name is

  ### Handles :thought_balloon:
  - handles are items that has been opened by the OS
  - handles are like pointers and point to a location in memory 
  - can store handle for later use
  - cannot perform arthmetic operations on handles
   

## File API

## Windows Registry
  -  used to store OS and program configuration info (eg. settings)
  -  good source of host-based indicator
  -  hierarchical database for info
  
  ### Registry Terms :thought_balloon:
  
  #### Root Keys

  #### Common Registry Functions
  
  #### Registry Tools
  1. Regedit
  2. Autoruns
  3. Regshot
  
## Networking API
  - programs uses socket (establish connection with remote connection) to listen & send data to the network
  - network sniffers :thought_balloon:
    - The following code creates a undetected network sniffer :
    - ??
    
  - WinINET API :thought_balloon:
    - higher level API that implements some higher level protocols
    - API in relation to internet

  - Downloaders :thought_balloon:
    - ??

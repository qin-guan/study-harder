# Windows Malware

Windows is the most popular OS.

Malware interacts with OS via API to execute code.

## Windows API

- Windows uses its own naming method to represent data types in the C programming language
- `WORD` = 16 bits unsigned value <sub><sup>(2 bytes)</sub></sup>
- `DWORD` = 32 bits unsigned value <sub><sup>(4 bytes)</sub></sup>
- Handles = ?
- Long Pointer = ?
- Callback = represents a function that will be called by the Windows API
- also uses Hungarian Notation for API function identifiers

### Hungarian Notation  

- Something like Camel Case , looking at the function name will depict the code's purpose
- eg. `CreateFile` / `ReadFile` / `WriteFile` - it does what its name states

### :thought_balloon: Handles

- Handles are items that has been opened by the OS
- Handles are like pointers and point to a location in memory
- Can store handle for later use
- Cannot perform arithmetic operations on handles

## File API

### :thought_balloon: File System Functions

`CreateFile`

:   Can open existing files, pipes, streams & I/O devices

`ReadFile` / `WriteFile`

:  

    Used to read/write to files

    When called, the function will read the first n number of bytes of the file. When called again, the next n number of bytes of the file will be read.

`CreateFileMapping` / `MapViewOfFile`

:   Something placeholder here.
  
## Windows Registry

- Used to store OS and program configuration info (eg. settings)
- Good source of host-based indicator
- Hierarchical database for info
  
### :thought_balloon: Registry Terms

#### Root Keys

#### Common Registry Functions

#### Registry Tools

1. Regedit
2. Autoruns
3. Regshot
  
## Networking API

- Programs uses socket (establish connection with remote connection) to listen & send data to the network

- Network sniffers :thought_balloon:
  - The following code creates a undetected network sniffer :
  `WSASocket()` / `socket()`
  : WSA = Windows Socket API , these two commands can be used to create a RAW Socket.
  
  `Bind()`
  : 
    binds socket to interface.
    binding attaches the connection (which is the socket) to the victim's computer, linking the victim's computer and the attacker
  
  `WSAloctl()` / `ioctlsocket()`
  : puts interface to promiscuous mode, meaning that the wired/wireless network interface controller

- WinINET API :thought_balloon:
  - higher level API that implements some higher level protocols
  - API used in malware means that the malware has relations to manipulating internet

    `InternetOpen`
    : start/initlaise a connection to Internet
    
    `InternetOpen URL`
    : connect to a URL
    
    `URLDownloadToFileA`
    : Downloads a file from the internet
    
    `InternetReadFile`
    : Reads a file off the internet
    

- Downloaders :thought_balloon:
  `URLDownloadToFile()` : Downloads a file off the internet
  
## Process Manipulation
- Some malwares hide

##Keyloggers
- Many bots & works uses this method of monitoring key strokes to spy on users and collect information
- Two Common methods:
    1. Install a hooke for keyboard events
    2. Poll keyboard state wiht `GetAsyncKeyState()`
    - Polling the keyboard
    - ?
    
- Hook

# Windows Malware

Windows is the most popular OS.

Malware interacts with OS via API to execute code.

## Windows API

  - Windows uses its own naming method to represent data types in the C programming language
  - `WORD` = 16 bits unsigned value <sub><sup>(2 bytes)</sub></sup>
  - `DWORD` = 32 bits unsigned value <sub><sup>(4 bytes)</sub></sup> 
  - Handles = ?
  - Long Pointer = ?
  - Callback = represents a function that will be called by the Windows API
  - also uses Hungarian Notation for API function identifiers
 
### Hungarian Notation  

  - Something like Camel Case , looking at the function name will depict the code's purpose
  - eg. CreateFile / ReadFile / WriteFile - it does what its name is

### Handles :thought_balloon:

  - Handles are items that has been opened by the OS
  - Handles are like pointers and point to a location in memory 
  - Can store handle for later use
  - Cannot perform arithmetic operations on handles
   

## File API

Something here...

## Windows Registry

  -  Used to store OS and program configuration info (eg. settings)
  -  Good source of host-based indicator
  -  Hierarchical database for info
  
### Registry Terms :thought_balloon:

#### Root Keys

#### Common Registry Functions

#### Registry Tools
  1. Regedit
  2. Autoruns
  3. Regshot
  
## Networking API
  - Programs uses socket (establish connection with remote connection) to listen & send data to the network

  - Network sniffers :thought_balloon:
    - The following code creates a undetected network sniffer :
    - ??
    
  - WinINET API :thought_balloon:
    - higher level API that implements some higher level protocols
    - API in relation to internet

  - Downloaders :thought_balloon:
    - ??

  - If you want to know more details on certain functions, refer to the documentation

# Computer Forensics

## Background & Scope of Computer Forensics

- Computers are either used as a tool to commit a crime or have become a target for these crimes
- Cyber crime encompasses any criminal act dealing with computers and networks
  - Includes traditional crimes that are committed through the use of a computer and the Internet
- Computer Forensics are commonly used to solve both cyber and traditional crimes

## Objective of Computer Forensics

- Recover, Analyze and Present material in such a way that it can be presented as evidence in a court of law

## 3 Stages in Forensics Investigation
### 1. Evidence Acquisition

 - Identification
   - FI starts investigation by identifying the evidence and its location
   - It is a challenge for FI to locate and identify information/data

 - Preservation
   - Forensic Investigator (FI) must preserve the integrity of the original evidence
   - Original evidence should not be modified or damaged
   - FI must make an image or/and a copy of original evidence before performing an analysis
   - FI should compare the copy with the original to identify any modifications or damages

 - Hashing
   - Prove that all evidences are exactly the same as the original data. Down to the very last bit.
   - Hash function is any well-defined procedure or mathematical function for turning data into a relatively small integer


### 2. Investigation & Analysis
 - Extraction
   - After Identifying and locating evidences. Data should be extracted immediately
   - Volatile data can be lost at any time. FI must use the copy to extract these data from the original evidence
   - Extracted data must be compared with original evidence and analyzed

 - Interpretation
   - Most Important role of FI during investigations is to interpret what the FI has found
   - Analysis and inspection of evidence must be interpreted in a lucid manner

### 3. Report Findings
 - Documentation
   - Documentation relating to evidence must be maintained from the beginning till the end of the investigation.
     - Includes the chain of custody forms

# AI and ML

## Types of learning

There are different ways to train a machine learning model (i.e. for it to "learn").

### Supervised learning

Supervised learning requires ==labelled data==.

Use cases:

* Classification models
  * i.e. Is this file malicious?
* Regression (prediction) models
  * Anomalies from the predicted regression can be flagged for further analysis
  * i.e. Predict number of logins for a user

### Unsupervised learning

Unsupervised learning ==DOES NOT NEED **labelled data**==

Through training, the model "discovers" patterns in data

Use cases:

* Clustering
  * i.e. Grouping similar files together
  * i.e. Grouping malware/network traffic into types
* Relationships / associations
  * i.e. What files are often used together?
  * i.e. Figuring out causal relationships between events

### Semi-supervised learning

Using a **mixture** of labelled and unlabelled data.

This is usually done when using fully labelled data is too expensive.

### Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of learning where the model is trained by interacting with its environment.

There is no training data, but feedback (e.g. good/bad) is given based on the solutions proposed by the model.

## Holistic cybersecurity program

Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover are the five pillars of the cybersecurity framework.

### Identify

Process of understanding the assets, threats and vulnerabilities of an organization.

Examples:

* Identifying physical and software assets to establish an Asset Management program
* Identifying a Risk Management Strategy for the organization

### Protect

Limit or contain the impact of potential cybersecurity events.

Outline safeguards for delivery of critical services.

Examples:

* Establishing ==data security== protection to protect the CIA triad
* Empowering staff within the organization through awareness and training

### Detect

Defines appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event in a timely manner.

Examples:

* Implementing continuous monitoring of the network
* Ensuring anomalies and events are detected and reported
* Verifying effectiveness of protective measures

### Respond

Appropriate activities to take action regarding a detected cybersecurity incident to minimize impact

Examples:

* Incident management + response
* Ensuring response planning processes are executed during and after an incident
* Managing communication during and after and event

1. SaaS

    Offers off-the-shelf convenience and ease of use.

    Provides flexibility due to access across devices and geographies.

    As a subscription-based model, it allows for budgeting and planning ahead.

    Self-provisioning (ability to add users as needed).

    No maintenance or installation requirements.

    You don't pay for the hardware that runs the application.

    You don't need to worry about maintenance or licensing fees.

  Nothing to install and no support worries.

2. PaaS

    PaaS provides a platform with tools to test, develop, and host applications in the same environment.

    Enables organizations to focus on development without having to worry about underlying infrastructure.

    Providers manage security, operating systems, server software and backups.

    Facilitates collaborative work even if teams work remotely.

3. IaaS

    Instead of purchasing hardware outright, users pay for laaS on demand.

    Infrastructure is scalable depending on processing and storage needs.

    Saves enterprises the costs of buying and maintaining their own hardware.

    Because data is on the cloud, there can be no single point of failure.

    Enables the virtualization of administrative tasks, freeing up time for other work.

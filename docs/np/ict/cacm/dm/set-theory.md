# Set theory

## Cardinality

Number of elements in a set.

$$

\cap(A \cup B) = \cap(A) + \cap(B) - \cap(A \cap B)

\newline

\cap(A \cap B) = 0

$$

## Subsets

### Proper subsets

### Improper subsets

## Disjoint sets

$$

\cap(A \cap B) = 0

$$

## Universal sets

Denoted by the synbol $\xi$

## Power set

## Product set

Set where all elements are tuples of elements from the original sets.

### Example

$$

S 

$$

## Venn diagrams

`Complement of set`

: All elements outside a set

`Union of sets`

: $\cup$ All elements in either set

`Intersection of sets`

: $\cap$ All elements in both sets

## Relative complement

$$

A \\ B = { x: x \epsilon A and x \not\epsilon B } or \\ = 

$$

## Symmetric difference

$A \oplus B$

Belongs to A + belongs to B, but not both

## Methods of proof of sets

### Venn diagrams proofs

### Set membership table

### Use basic laws or proven theorems

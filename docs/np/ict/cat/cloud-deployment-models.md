# Cloud deployment models

Private cloud

* Cloud provider is also the sole cloud consumer
* Hardware is maintained by consumer
* Unused resources during off peak hours

All in cloud

* All resources are hosted in a cloud provider
* Hardware is maintained by cloud provider
* Can scale up and down to meet demand

Hybrid cloud

* Resources are hosted in a combination of private and public cloud

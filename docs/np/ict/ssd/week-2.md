# Week 2

## Holistic security

This comprises 3 parts (application -> host -> network).

> Secure software is characterized by the securing of applications, hosts and networks holistically so there is no weak
> link

## Iron triangle constraints

1. Scope
2. Schedule
3. Cost

### Other challenges

* Security as an afterthought
  * Cost of fixing insecure software earlier in the SDLC is insignificant when compared to having the issue addressed in
    production
* Security vs usability
  * Incorporation of secure features can make the software more **complex, restrictive and unusable**
  * Comes at the cost of *performance and usability*
